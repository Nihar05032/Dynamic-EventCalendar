# React Calendar Application

## **Summary**
The **React Calendar Application** is an interactive web-based calendar that allows users to:
- View events in different formats (monthly, weekly, daily).
- Add new events with titles, descriptions, and time.
- Edit existing events.
- Delete events after confirmation.
- Save and retrieve events using local storage.
- Highlight Sundays and format event dates for better visibility.

This project is built using **React.js** with the help of the `@fullcalendar/react` library for calendar functionality.
